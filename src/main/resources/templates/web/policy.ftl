    Application <i>`Hunter-Secretary`</i> is an experimental project intended to automate the
    communication process between recruiter and candidate.
</p>

<p>
    In particular, in a situation of huge number of incoming messages from recruiters,
    it is quite hard to respond to everybody in relevant time frame.
    This tool <i>`Hunter-Secretary`</i> is designed mostly for self-usage by its main developer.
    However, everybody are welcome to test it, participate in development and leave feedback.
    Please check GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/nantipov/hunter-secretary">https://github.com/nantipov/hunter-secretary</a>.
