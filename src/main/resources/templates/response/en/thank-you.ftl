Thank you for your message.
This response is written by a self-made bot which is called `Hunter-Secretary` (HS), but please do not consider it as a robotic message.
It is just a method for quick and comprehensive replying after review made by human (me :-)).

I reviewed your message and asked `HS` to respond as quantity of incoming messages is quite noticeable.

Thank you for the opportunity, but I am not looking for a new job at the moment. However, I am always open for new contacts and glad to help.
Of course, if something changed in future in regard to my work conditions, I will be glad to return to this topic.

Meanwhile, you can check my web-site and networking profiles.
