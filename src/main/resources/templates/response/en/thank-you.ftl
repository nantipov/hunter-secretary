Thank you for your message and the opportunity, but I am not looking for a new job at the moment. However, I am always open for new contacts and glad to help.
Of course, if something changed in future in regard to my work conditions, I will be glad to return to this topic.

Meanwhile, you can check my web-site and networking profiles.
